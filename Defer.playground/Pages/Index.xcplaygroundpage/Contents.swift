 # Defer

 This playground demonstrates the use of the `defer` keyword introduced\
 in Swift 2. It contains a few simple, straightforward and practical\
 uses of the keyword and several convoluted and contrived ones.

 The intention of this playground is just for you to learn how this\
 keyword/feature works. There are better sources than this to help you\
 decide how and where to use it in your production code.

 With that said, let's dive into `defer`!
